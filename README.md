# Lottery Number Picker

This is a simple lottery number picker project. I was asked to code this during a technical interview many years ago. I wanted to write an implementation of it for fun.


## Instructions on Running the Project

1. Make sure Node is installed. You can install it at [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run build` to build the project.
5. Run `npm run start` to start the application.
6. Open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to play the lottery number picker game.


### Running Tests

- Run `npm run test` to run the unit tests.
- Run `npm run dev2:1` and `npm run dev2:2` simultaneously to run the application in development mode with hot reloading and auto-restart.


## Instructions for Your Own Development

- When importing, use `.js` file extensions. For example, write import statements such as `import foo from './foo.js'`.
